# ineedideas

A entirely useless tool created out one of my plethora of ideas, or, more accurately, my distinct lack of them.
Shoves random words together from the dictionary in a massively overengineered way.

That's it.

Examples:
```
self-reverent Ossietzky Epinephelidae 
predelude 
unfeudally saberleg 
sparkishly scrutinies touted 
Trinkgeld arsenfast Hoshi columellae 
gyniolatry antiliturgist establishmentarian 
voluntarist plasia wood-turning 
Seana 
beau-ideal mycologists motograph superimply 
snyes
```

## Quickstart

requires cmake and a working c compiler

```console
git clone https://github.com/BenjaminHinchliff/ineedideas.git
cd ineedideas
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
